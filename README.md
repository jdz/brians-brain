[Brian's brain](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brian%27s_Brain)
implementation in Common Lisp, as described on my
[blog](https://blog.jonis.lv/) (with
minor tweaks, like system and package names).

After loading, use the following code for an endless movie:

```lisp
(brians-brain:run 160 100 640 400)
```
